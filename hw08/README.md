I was unable to get the screenshots from the oscilliscopes to open on my computer.
## Blinking an LED

The fastest  I was able to blink the LED was at 12.5 MHz with a Std. Deviation of 40.928 kHz.

## PWM Generator

I was able to bring the PWM up to 50 MHz, but with 110.43 MHz Std. Deviation.

## Four Outputs

The fastest I was able to get the four outputs was 12.5 MHz, but with that speed each channel had only 10 Hz of Std. Deviation.

## Reading Inputs

I found the code was able to respond to the inputs with only a few ns of delay. 


## Prof. Yoder's comments

Did you try looking at the screenshots using Cloud9?

PWM Generator:  110 MHz is a huge Std.  Did you try resetting the stats?

Reading Inputs: Could you give a number of ns?
